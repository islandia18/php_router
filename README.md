# PhpRouter
PHP router inspired on FatFree, CakePHP and own invention. 

It allows to use anonymous functions as callback as well as OOP classes and methods. 
In addition, it detects if request is asynchronous or not (defined by [ajax] tag in rute definition).

## Installation

Just clone that repository or use composer:

```bash
composer require plugowski/php_router
```

Next in your project create `.htaccess` file which point on your dispatcher file:

```apache
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-l
    RewriteRule .* index.php?url=$1 [QSA,L]
</IfModule>
```

## Usage

Basic usage looks like code below:

```php
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use PhpRouter\Route;
use PhpRouter\RouteCollection;
use PhpRouter\Router;
use PhpRouter\RouteRequest;

$routing = new RouteCollection();
$routing->attach(new Route('GET /', function(){
    echo 'Hello World';
}));

(new Router(new RouteRequest(), $routing))->run();
```

If you want to trigger OOP classes and methods, just write full namespace and method reference (`->` or `::`):

```php
new Route('GET /', '\Full\Namespace\Class->method');
```

For named parameters use `@name` tag, for example:

```php
new Route('GET /order/@id', '\Full\Namespace\Class->method');
```

Standard all named parameters will be recognized as `(\w-)+`, but if you want to define your own pattern,
do it in second argument as associative array, where keys match to `@` tag:

```php
// $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] = '/order/14-XA-43321'
new Route('GET /order/@id', ['id' => '\d{2}\-\w{2}\-\d{5}'], function($params) {
  echo 'Order ID: ' . $params['id']; // Order ID: 14-XA-43321 
});
```

All named params are passed into called function as associative array in first argument.
